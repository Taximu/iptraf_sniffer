# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è IP Traffic Sniffer (C#)

A simple and lightweight C# tool that captures and logs IP network traffic. This utility can be used to monitor, inspect, and analyze IPv4 packets flowing through a network interface in real time.

---

## üì¶ What This Repository Contains

- **Core packet capture logic** using raw sockets or WinPcap (depending on implementation)
- **Packet parser** to decode IP headers and extract key fields:
  - Source & destination IP addresses  
  - Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)  
  - Packet length and other metadata
- **Logging output** to console or file for analysis
- **Extensible code structure**‚Äîeasily plug in custom filters or handlers

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Real‚Äëtime capture of IPv4 traffic
- Support for multiple protocols (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
- Decodes header information and displays it in a readable format
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into C#/.NET projects
